# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction Analysis
An end-to-end Diabetes Risk Prediction project analyzing 750+ patient records to identify key health risk factors and build a machine learning model achieving 89% accuracy and 0.91 ROC-AUC for early high-risk detection.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end Diabetes Risk Prediction system built using clinical health data to identify high-risk patients. The objective is to analyze key medical indicators and develop a machine learning model that supports early detection and preventive healthcare decisions.

The final model achieved:

- ✅ 89% Accuracy  
- ✅ 0.91 ROC-AUC Score  
- ✅ 25% improvement in high-risk patient identification
